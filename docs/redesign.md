# Specifications

## Goals at the end of this sprint

- Rebrand (name, logo, design)
- Good enough to release as Saas version (29â‚¬/year)

## About this app

Will stay a one personn project. keeping that in mind, evey new features is really time consuming.  
Hope to generate some income with Saas version, but main goal is to use in my portfolio.

## Concept

Personnal budget app (or Personal Finance Manager), to track expenses per month, per category, and per event.

**Main arguments:** Multi currency, multi account, shared budget for events, self hostable, open source.

*Build with intensive traveling in mind (not sure if we should target this audience first).*

**What this app will not do:** Connect to bank account and automatically report transaction. Be used to pay bills. I guess it's more of a tracking than a managing system.

## Structure

Code is web based, but could/will be bundle as native app (desktop, tablet, phone). Needs to be responsive, same code for every plateform. Design should be app oriented, not website oriented.

### Website

- Homepage

### App

- Login page
	- Sign up
	- Forgotten password

	- Categories
	- Events (shared budget feature)
	- Changes
	- Settings

### Facebook chatbot (not implemented yet)

- Simple form to create new transaction.
		
## Key word

Simplicity. Transparency. Efficiency.

## Fun facts

- This project was first named **723e** *(723e.com)*. Was created because my month salary was 723 euros and I needed an app to properly manage it. Tryed to rebrand **seven23** but ... need to be convainced about it.  
- Before this, I was using an Apple Number spreedsheats *(I know, stupid idea)*, but data got corrupted and everything got lost. This was like april 2009 *(yeap, that's a long story)*.

## Current version

Website does not exist yet. Will be [seven23.io](seven23.io).

Working prototype using Google Material design. Available at [app.seven23.io](app.seven23.io).
It works, but it's still ugly. Still a lot to do, but need a boost.

Need to improve pedagogy, should be more explicit and guide new users.  
Currently only one user, and two testers :). Very small project, but used everyday.
